# Bubble-sort
This is a visualisation of the bubble sort algorithm

This program makes one check to see if the current block is greater than the next block,
if so then it swaps it, if not then it just continues to the next block

It checks to see if it is sorted by counting how many blocks it has checked without swapping,
and if the count is equal to the length of the list then it means the list is sorted :D

We can figure out the worst case scenario for this algorithm (meaning that the largest amount of iterations it would take to sort the list).
For the Bubble sort it is represented by this funky notation O(n^2) called Big O notation, which in simple terms is the length of the list squared.
So, if we had 50 items that we wanted to sort, the largest amount of iterations it take to solve it would be 2500 - 
that's a lot!
There are many more efficient algorithms than the Bubble sort with better worst case scenarios

I used Object Oriented programming for representing the blocks. Although its not the most efficient way,
because for 1000 items it would have to create 1000 objects but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
 
Enjoy!
